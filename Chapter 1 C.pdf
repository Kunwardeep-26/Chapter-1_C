Chapter 1: Variables, Constants, and Keywords:
Variables
A variable is a container that stores a ‘value’. In the kitchen, 
we have containers storing rice, dal, sugar, etc. Similar to that 
variable in c stores value of a constant. 
Example:

   a = 3;          //a is assigned “3”

   b =4.7;        //b is assigned “4.7”

   c=’A’;          //c is assigned “A”

Rules for naming variables in c:
1. The first character must be an alphabet or underscore(_).

2. No commas, blanks allow.

3. No special symbol other than underscore is allowed

4. Variable names are case sensitive

Constants
An entity whose value doesn’t change is called a constant.

Types of constant
Primarily there are 3 types of constant:

Integer constant =    -1,6,7,9
Real constant =     -322.1,2.5,7.0
Character constant = ‘a’,’$’,’@’(must be enclosed within single inverted
 commas)
Keywords
These are reserved words, whose meaning is already known to the compiler. 
There are 32 keywords available in c:

auto	double	int	struct
break	long	else 	switch
case	return 	enum	typedef
char	register	extern	union
const	short	float	unsigned
continue	signed	for	void
default	sizeof	goto	volatile
do	static	if 	while

Our first C program

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

printf(“Hello, I am learning C with Harry”);
return 0;

}
The basic structure of a C program:-
All c programs have to follow a basic structure. A c program starts with the 
main function and executes instructions presents inside it. Each instruction 
terminated with a semicolon(;)

There are some basic rules which are applicable to all the c programs:

1. Every program's execution starts from the main function.
2. All the statements are terminated with a semi-colon.
3. Instructions are case sensitive.
4. Instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written.
Comments:-
Comments are used to clarify something about the program in plain language.
It is a way for us to add notes to our program. There are two types of 
comments in c:

1. Single line comment: //This is a comment.
2. Multi line comment : /*This is multi line comment*/
Comments in a C program are not executed and ignored.
Compilation and execution:-
A compiler is a computer program which converts a c
program into machine language so that it can be easily 
understood by the computer

A program is written in plain text. This plain text is a combination
of instructions in a particular sequence. The compiler performs some 
basic checks and finally convert the program into an executable.
Library functions:-
C language has a lot of valuable library functions which is used to 
carry out a certain task, for instance, printf function is used to 
print values on the screen.
printf(“This is %d”,i);

// %d for integers

// %f for real values

// %c for characters
Types of variables:-
1. Integer variables - int a=3;
2. Real variables -  int a=7.7 (wrong as 7.7 is real) ; float a=7.7;
3. Character variables - char a=’B’;
Receiving input from the user:-
In order to take input from the user and assign it to a variable, we
use scanf function.

The syntax for using scanf:
scanf(“%d”,&i); // [This & is important]
& is the “address of” operator and it means that the supplied 
value should be copied to the address which is indicated by variable i.
